# Session 7

After fight club Liana wakes up next to a body

Liana invites Roanmara to come look

They investigate the body, finding a message and ring

They hide the body under the floor and Liana disappears to the Morgrave University

Cut to the rest of the group, getting breakfast in the bar. Nosirrah and Balasar get cheese toasties.

The rest of you spend the session tracking down Yvonnaâ€™s house and fight those people outside it.

A group of elven women can be seen leaving the bar, looking at the group. Someone overhears, in elvish, "Did you know Narissa died in the night? She became a danger to the cause." before leaving

The group exits and plans what they'll do in a nearby alleyway.

Eventually they choose to track down Yvonnas house, all they know is a direction.

Heading that way they find the entrance into the tower (TODO: name?) and a large central road (there's a fancy word for this, like in Eisenhorn when the imperial parade is attacked). Mostly residential on the right hand side and mostly businesses on the left, the areas nearest the road are mostly given over to markets.

They decide to go find info in the market, hoping to find people who know of Yvonna or general info.

Mialee disguises herself as Yvonna, using Alter Self, and begins walking through the stalls until someone notices her.

Eventually a gnome selling various alchemical goods rushes to greet her.

Mialee places an order and asks for it to be delivered in an hours time.

The group blends in nearby, waiting for the merchant to pack up and deliver the goods. Barry plays music to the crowds.

They trail the merchant through the streets until he enters the residential side which is mostly laid out in city blocks. Balasar goes one way hoping to get a different view, testing his new wings on the way. The others follow directly.

Eventually the gnome enters onto a street ending in a culdesac, with 3 humanoid and 1 canine shapes. The group hangs back on the steps of a dilapitated building, Balasar lands on a roof overlooking the streets. As the merchant is motioned over by the figures, Nosirrah causes a commotion through some poor stealth work and capitalises on it, running down the street shouting.

The figures are alarmed and run over to investigate, the party ambush them and combat ensues.

Turns out it's a Wight, 2 Karnathi Skeletons in hooded robes and an Iron Defender (TODO: Pictures?)

They win, with Mialee taking the bulk of the damage as the party learns to start thinking tactically about combat.

Looting the bodies, they find some mundane weapons an armor bits. Nossirah takes the sword of the Wight, it's magical, that's cool.

They move the bodies off the street and hide in the building they were hiding against to take a short rest.

SESSION END.
