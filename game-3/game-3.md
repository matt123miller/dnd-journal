# Session 3

Barry, Nosirrah and Balasar are tentatively inspecting the bundle of robes while the rest of the group catch up.

Nosirrah pokes it with his foot to see if the wearer is still alive. The bundle of robes suddenly react and expand rapidly, creating the flesh golem.

Fight the big bad monster.

Liana enjoys some grappling hook action.

Nosirrah casts fog. This is a mistake. Nobody can see anything

Barry charges into the fog to attack the golem, suddenly meets it and takes a beating.

Towards the end the Kings Citadel come running in

Throughout the fight Roanmara hears grunts or screams of pain, words of anger.

Beat monster. It's flesh comes apart and falls into a bundle before them all.

Yvonna inside casts Thunderwave, knocking people back, before running and jumping off the bridge and turning to flip off the party. Specifically looks at Roanmara and says into her mind "I'll be coming for you. Soon."

Introduced to Rozar Thunderbrand

Go back to Lucky Llama and give dundeek his llama.

Talk to Rozar, info about Yvonna, very little though, just her name and that she's in Precarious

Dundeek gives players some magical llama juice of healing and doesn't charge them for their nights stay. Pours beer into the ear of the llama, out of the foot comes the golden liquid.

Nosirrah and Rozar Thunderbrand shook mage hands

Out of Balasar's backpack comes a cracking noise. Fang is born.
