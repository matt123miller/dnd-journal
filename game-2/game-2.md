Goes into silver flame temple

Speaks to Mina

It's the wrong temple! Oh no

She tells them of the correct temple

Directs them to Dundeek's tavern, the Lucky Llama

Something about the water in the temple, I think it healed 1hp when Barry tried it.

Group heads to Dundeek

When passing through the market Barry gets pick pocketed by a kid

They chase the kid through the streets and into some alleyways

Lose the kid, hear some shouting, chase down the noise

Find Balasar the dragonborn in an alley, standing between the group, an npc and a gelatinous cube

They fight it, eventually pushing it back into the sewer whilst fighting it and the npc kept trying to help

Balasar introduces himself

Thingly veiled excuse to all to the the Lucky Llama, introductions on the way

Not sure what happened there, Barry probbaly plays music

They go to bed

In the morning as they're preparing for the day someone steals the titular golden Llama from Dundeek's bar.

They give chase into the street, chasing the thief through the crowd. Liana goes on the rooves and fails at the end, falling into the fish. We all remember that.

Barry puts people to sleep, eventually gets the thief

Balasar begins to intimidate him, lifting him into the air and takes the llama back.

A body suddenly impacts the floor next to them, wrapped in a cloak. 

Looking up the see a bridge above with people gesticulating over the edge

Looking back to the body, they see a hand sticking out from the cloak with pulsating grey tattoos on it.
