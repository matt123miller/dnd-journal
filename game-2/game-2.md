# Game 2

Standing in front of the temple....

Stepping out from the bustle of the market and onto the steps of the temples ahead was a strange sensation, like their ears were waterlogged. The sounds and jostling and the crowd suddenly died away, seemingly held within the silk and hempen awnings and stalls of strange goods. Ahead lay the two temples overlooking the plaza. Columns of marble and basalt towered over all leaving the lasting impression of granduer and onlookers feeling insignificant among the greater movements of the world.

Mialee leading them onwards, the group ascended the steps. Liana hung back awkwardly, unsure of how to proceed, discomfort pooling in her stomach. _Why is it always religious._ Arranging the cloak around her shoulders and breathing some strength back into her body, Liana strode forward and projected a confidence she wasn't sure she felt, walls raised high against the world.

At the top they were met by shimmering light, quiet and space. Space that was hard to come by in the heaving metropolis of sharn. Laying before them was a wide open square bordered by the columns with a large pool of clear water in the centre.

TODO: Fact check my silver flame lore.

The far side of the temple was devoted to a wall and an enormous mural. Depicted in paint and chiseled stone was a scene taught to all initiates and followers of The Silver Flame. On the left were depictions of eery (TODO: Were they?) humans, devoid of any blemish or imperfection, charging down ranks of fleeing demons on the right. Between the two forces a woman stood on a rock above the battle brandishing a golden sword and clad in ornate silvery armour, shouting encouragement to those below as she battled an enormous catlike demon. It was snarling, wounded and cowering outside the pillar of burning bright light surrounding the woman. _Tira Minon_ thought Nosirrah, remembering history lessons from his youth. The war against the Great Rakshasah had been bloody and long before Tira sacrificed herself, sealing the demons in their own twisted realm while binding her soul to the gateway forever.

The group hung awkwardly near the pillars, unsure whether to cross into the temple proper and disturb the tranquility within.

"Anybody home?" Liana projecting her brash veneer with voice into the temple,  gentle echoes rebounding off the polished stone. As the hanging cadence of her question faded they waited a few heatbeats more.

Roanmara stepped forwards, ushering the others to follow. "See? Nothing to fear here." She walked curiously towards the pool, the light of multiple torches reflecting wildly off the surface of the water and casting their radiance throughout the space. The water was slowly moving in circles around the pool, miniature waves sometimes rolling over the edge onto the surrounding stone before the droplets slid gently back to join their brethren.

"Curious." stated Barry, appearing at her side. "I've never seen water do that before. I don't feel any movement, do you?" Roanmara shook her head gently. "Maybe it's magical..." he said, voice trailing away in wonder. 

Liana joined them, staring down at the water. "Of course it is, look at it. Besides, Holy Water is meant to be really good for you." she nodded in a knowledgable fashion. "You should drink it, you look pretty ragged after all the fun this morning."
