# Game 2.1

Standing in front of the temple....

Stepping out from the bustle of the market and onto the steps of the temples ahead was a strange sensation, like their ears were waterlogged. The sounds and jostling and the crowd suddenly died away, seemingly held within the silk and hempen awnings and stalls of strange goods. Ahead lay the two temples overlooking the plaza. Columns of marble and basalt towered over all leaving the lasting impression of granduer and onlookers feeling insignificant among the greater movements of the world. On the left stood the temple of The Silver Flame, an ornate silver arrowhead wreathed in fire hung from between two central columns. To it's right was the temple for The Sovreign Host, the geometric yellow and blue cross bars of it's symbol embossed on the octagon commonly worn by it's followers.

Mialee leading them onwards, the group ascended the steps. Liana hung back awkwardly, unsure of how to proceed, discomfort pooling in her stomach. _Why is it always religious._ Arranging the cloak around her shoulders and breathing some strength back into her body, Liana strode forward and projected a confidence she wasn't sure she felt, walls raised high against the world.

At the top they were met by shimmering light, quiet and space. Space that was hard to come by in the heaving metropolis of sharn. Laying before them was a wide open square bordered by the columns with a large pool of clear water in the centre.

TODO: Fact check my silver flame lore.

The far side of the temple was devoted to a wall and an enormous mural. Depicted in paint and chiseled stone was a scene taught to all initiates and followers of The Silver Flame. On the left were depictions of eery (TODO: Were they?) humans, devoid of any blemish or imperfection, charging down ranks of fleeing demons on the right. Between the two forces a woman stood on a rock above the battle brandishing a golden sword and clad in ornate silvery armour, shouting encouragement to those below as she battled an enormous catlike demon. It was snarling, wounded and cowering outside the pillar of burning bright light surrounding the woman. _Tira Miron_ thought Nosirrah, remembering history lessons from his youth. The war against the Great Rakshasah had been bloody and long before Tira sacrificed herself, sealing the demons in their own twisted realm while binding her soul to the gateway forever.

The group hung awkwardly near the pillars, unsure whether to cross into the temple proper and disturb the tranquility within.

"Anybody home?" Liana projecting her brash veneer with voice into the temple,  gentle echoes rebounding off the polished stone. As the hanging cadence of her question faded they waited a few heatbeats more.

Roanmara stepped forwards, ushering the others to follow. "See? Nothing to fear here." She walked curiously towards the pool, the light of multiple torches reflecting wildly off the surface of the water and casting their radiance throughout the space. The water was slowly moving in circles around the pool, miniature waves sometimes rolling over the edge onto the surrounding stone before the droplets slid gently back to join their brethren.

"Curious." stated Barry, appearing at her side. "I've never seen water do that before. I don't feel any movement, do you?" Roanmara shook her head gently. "Maybe it's magical..." he said, voice trailing away in wonder. 

Liana joined them, staring down at the water. "Of course it is, look at it. Besides, Holy Water is meant to be really good for you." she nodded in a knowledgable fashion. "You should drink it, you look pretty ragged after all the fun this morning."

Barry stood for a moment, consequences running through his mind. _What if it's poisonous? We get caught? I suddenly grow a third arm? That could be useful on stage actually..._ Stealing himself for the task ahead he took a flask from his pack and bent down. "Hey, it'll make a good story right?" The metal broke through the surface of the wateras if there were an actual barrior there. Initial resistance gave way under light pressure, Barry's hand lurching forwards into the liquid before he could compensate against the momentum. It was strangely warm to the touch, at odds with the chill of the morning. _Maybe they pipe heat up from the Cogs_ he thought idly before removing his flask upwards. A faint afterglow was left behind where he had touched the water. Lifting it to his mouth he took a gentle sip and let it wash around his mouth before swallowing. It was thicker than he expected, sweet and delicate like watered wine. 

"So, how is it!" Nosirrah said, leaning inwards with interest dancing across his face. Barry stood for a moment contemplating the feeling. He felt all the fatigue of the morning fade away, replaced by a warm glow that began in his stomach and spread outwards, down his arms and legs and into the very tips of his fingers.

"Brilliant. Really, just brilliant." Barry was grinning now, the warmth remaining in his hands. He went back for a second mouthful, eager to chase that feeling again before a strangers voice echoed throughout the temple. 

"I wouldn't, if I were you."

The group turned in shock, Barry sheepish to be caught and now unsure of his actions.

"It's not harmful, at least not straight away." Walking towards them was a gnome, her shoulder length hair gone mostly to grey, with piercing blue eyes and wearing a simple white robe belted at the waist by belt of braided brown leather. Though she walked with a cane there was a strength of purpose and charisma to her that belied her frame and appearance. "Welcome to my humble temple. I'm Mina. I bet you feel fabulous right now, huh?" her sing song voice carried the distance between them, rapidly reducing as she walked. "But too much of a good thing, hmmm? Be proud you could take our holy water at all though. Only those with a good heart can pierce the veil, let alone take something with them."

"There was....it didn't let me through at first." Barry admitted, a little embarassed. _Why am I saying this?_

"Well, we can't all be pure all the time can we?" Mina chuckled, as she crouched down and effortlessly draged her finger tips through the liquid, leaving luminous trails behind as she went. "Now what can I do for you all? Are you children of The Flame?" The most anybody could offer was an awkward shuffle, uncomfortable to take any side in the matter. Mina began leading them away towards the mural at the back of the chamved. "That's OK, faith is a perculiar thing. As long as you are out in the world helping those who need it then you're doing well in my mind." She smiled at them all.

Liana's mouth contracted slightly as she was subtly dragging the hooked flap of her Tiefling tail over the surface of the water whilst looking about the room, unable to push through the barrier try as she might.

Nossirah stepped forwards to walk beside Mina. "We were actually looking for Sarah, Sarah Shimmerstein? I don't suppose this is her temple?"

"Oh! Oh how kind! I'm truly flattered you could confuse my humble temple for hers. No no, she maintains our grand temple up in Skyway" and she gestured up through the ceiling. "I try to visit twice a year but I can't afford it on the meager donations we recieve here in Tavicks Landing."

"That's unfortunate." replied Nosirrah curtly. "See, we just saved her life on the Lightning Rail and she promised us board and reward in return. 200 gold pieces to be precise. I don't suppose you could provide the same services to us?"

It was Mina's turn to shuffle uncomfortably. "It sounds like you performed a great deed, saving the life of such a wonderful woman. But I'm afraid all I can offer, such as it is, are the blessings of Tira Miron. We have rooms here for sure, but they're reserved for the poorest of this neighourhood during the night time, for their protection you see."

Barry stepped in to smother any further problems. "That's no problem Mina. Could you at least guide us to the nearest inn or other such establishment? Saving important members of clergy is thirsty work you see."

"Of course! I'm no stranger in the community here and that includes a few of the more reputable inns and ale houses." She walked back towards the front steps of the temple. Leaning out from the columns she directed them to the right and pointed down the street. "Head down there and follow the signs towards Greenglass, you can't miss it that bridge. By there you'll find the Lucky Llama, the barman Dundeek is a good friend of mine."

Barry put a hand on Mina's diminutive shoulder. "Thank you, Mina. When we find Sarah I'll pass on a good word. Maybe she'll come visit you instead."

"No thank you! It's nice to talk to people other than the usual drunks and those down on their luck this area seems to be overflowing with." Mina sighed, hands on her hips. "Good luck in your journeys!"

As the group walked down the steps Barry called over his shoulder "Come by this Lucky Llama later tonight, Barry the Bard will be playing I have no doubt!" Leaving the quiet contemplation of the temple behind they set out back into the city, the sounds of it's many inhabitants already washing over them all. Barry's fingertips were still brimming with the warmth of the holy water. _This is great._
