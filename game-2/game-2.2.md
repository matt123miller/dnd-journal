# Game 2.2

That feeling wouldn't last however. As they left the temple behind and begun to walk among the crowds of people again, Liana said "Well at least it wasn't a total waste. Mina has a new admirer" she poked Barry hard in the arm "and you get to put on a show later."

"'Scuse me mister!" Barry turned to see a Goblin girl, smaller even than the few Goblins Barry had encountered during his travels. She was surrounded by a group of children all rushing to get through. As they whipped through Barry felt something brush his hip and instinct made him lunge a hand outwards. His fingers clamped down on a wafer thin wrist. Turning, he saw a Kobold struggling to break free of his grip, one hand holding Barry's coin purse. Scaled fronds skin, enforced with spines, ran from the top of their head down to the middle of their back.

The Kobold's struggling changed for just a moment as they lay their other hand on Barry's firm grip, which suddenly released as a small arc of lightning surged up his arm. Barry exhaled sharply with the shock. With that the Kobold ran, trying desperately to disappear into the crowds with their friends as Barry began to give chase.

Shouting for the authorities, Barry was fighting his way through the early morning crowd, bumping into people as he ran. His companions were already following, trying to catch up. Breaking free of the market he ran after the children, following a whirl of fabric and the sing-song of young laughter he careened down alleyways, turning from one into the next. The already dim light of the day didn't penetrate far into this warren. Grey and brown walls drunk in what light remained, enhancing the gloom and poverty of the place. Skidding to a halt, his new found allies only seconds behind, Barry was rotating wildly on the spot.

"I lost them! Damn kids!" He sent alley detritus sliding away from his frustrated kick. "I would've offered them food or money if only they'd ask."

Liana stepped forward. "Look, Barry, it probably wasn't their fault." offering some awkward comfort she wasn't sure she meant. "I bet they have some fence leaning on them, forcing them to steal for bread and somewhere to stay that's less damp than the rest. Trust me, I know." Liana turned away, shrugging and preparing to move off to find their way back to the relative safety and light of the main streets. She paused.

"Hey, Barry, stop it for a second." she hissed, waving a placating hand in his direction. "You hear that?"

Everyone strained their ears, cocking their heads to the side to try and pick up any sound they could. Suddenly, a voice cried out, echoing down the alleyways as the sound reverberated off the claustrophobic walls and the many walkways that snaked between buildings above them. 

"Pain" said Roanmara simply, before running after it's source, bounding along. It couldn't be far, but direction and distance were blurred in this environment. Reaching the end of one narrowly ending alleyway, the path suddenly opened up to something akin to a real street. 20ft of stone cobbles stretched from one wall to the other, doorways and steps up to entranceways lined the street, lanterns hung at irregular intervals. They were still lit, despite the hour, and they were all better off for it. Everything was made of the same grey stonework as before, the colour washed out of the world.
