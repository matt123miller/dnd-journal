Barry goes to say hi, offers a sandwich, Mialee makes it taste like poo. Classic

Cultists come in, they have tattoos

cultists put the silver flame group to sleep, Liana noticed

They eventually fight, uses the train terrain for a fun fight climbing over things and whatnot

The Dwarf is pushed into the glass and would fall through the window, but the electricity gets him and sends his burnt body back into the car.
